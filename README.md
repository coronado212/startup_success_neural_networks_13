# Startup Success - Neural Networks

![](Images/vc.png)

You work as a risk management associate at Alphabet Soup, a venture capital firm. Alphabet Soupâ€™s business team receives many funding applications from startups every day. This team has asked you to help them create a model that predicts whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.

The business team has given you a CSV file containing more than 34,000 organizations that have received funding from Alphabet Soup over the years. The CSV file contains a variety of information about each business, including whether or not it ultimately became successful. With your knowledge of machine learning and neural networks, you decide to use the features in the provided dataset to create a binary classifier model that will predict whether an applicant will become a successful business.

## Technologies

This project leverages python 3.7 with the following packages:

* [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) - The TensorFlow 2.0 library has several dependencies, which should already be installed in the default Conda environment.

* [Keras](https://keras.io/about/) - A deep learning API written in Python, running on top of the machine learning platform TensorFlow.

## Installation Guide

    
To install TensorFlow, open the terminal, and execute the following command:


    pip install --upgrade tensorflow

To install Keras, open the terminal, and execute the following command:


    python -c "import tensorflow as tf;print(tf.keras.__version__)"

## Usage

To predict whether Alphabet Soup funding applicants will be successful, you will create a binary classification model using a deep neural network.

This challenge consists of three technical deliverables:

Preprocess data for a neural network model.

Use the model-fit-predict pattern to compile and evaluate a binary classification model.

Optimize the model.
